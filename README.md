Participants were asked to rate how difficult they thought different routes looked along three scales: Easy-Demanding, Forgiving-Punishing, Simple-Complex. They were shown ten images in total, where five images depicted routes in environments we classified as complex, and five routes in environments we classified as easy. Each image was shown for 20 seconds prior to asking the participant to rate the route on the image.

These are the images used in the survey.
